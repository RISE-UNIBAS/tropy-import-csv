# tropy-import-csv

Import data from a CSV into Tropy 1.11.0.

## Quickstart

First convert the CSV into a JSON-LD by running `csv2json(DIR + "/test.csv", DIR + "/test.json", "C:\\Path\\to\\photos-folder")`. For the import of the JSON-LD into Tropy, follow these instructions: https://docs.tropy.org/using-tropy/add_files#importing-json-ld-files

The CSV to be imported into Tropy must be structured according to the output generated by [https://github.
com/inukshuk/tropy-plugin-csv](https://github.com/inukshuk/tropy-plugin-csv). For the "Tropy Generic"-Template, this 
yields as header the sequence of properties as with the addition of `Tags`, `Photos`, and `Notes`:

``"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/source","https://tropy.org/v1/tropy#collection","https://tropy.org/v1/tropy#box","https://tropy.org/v1/tropy#folder","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/rights",Tags,Photos,Notes``

`Tags` and `Notes` are not yet implemented.
