Import data from a CSV into Tropy 1.11.0.

Access this binder at the following URL

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RISE-UNIBAS/tropy-import-csv.git/HEAD?labpath=interactive.ipynb

## Quickstart without Binder

First convert the CSV into a JSON-LD by running 

```
Transform.csv2json(csv_path=DIR + "/sample.csv", 
                   json_path=DIR + "/sample.json", 
                   photos_path="/Path/to/photos/")
```

Note that the CSV must be structured according to the output generated by [https://github.
com/inukshuk/tropy-plugin-csv](https://github.com/inukshuk/tropy-plugin-csv). So far only the "Tropy Generic"-template is implemented, requiring the following header:

``"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/source","https://tropy.org/v1/tropy#collection","https://tropy.org/v1/tropy#box","https://tropy.org/v1/tropy#folder","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/rights",Tags,Photos,Notes``

`Tags` and `Notes` are not yet implemented.

For the import of the JSON-LD into Tropy, follow these instructions: https://docs.tropy.org/using-tropy/add_files#importing-json-ld-files
